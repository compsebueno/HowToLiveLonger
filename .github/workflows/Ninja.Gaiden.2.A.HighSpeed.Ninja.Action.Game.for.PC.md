Ninja Gaiden 2 has received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans alike. The game has been praised for its intense and satisfying combat system, its variety of weapons and enemies, its improved save system and health regeneration, and its impressive graphics and sound effects. The game has also been criticized for its frustrating camera angles, its uneven difficulty and cheap deaths, its nonsensical story and characters, and its lack of innovation and polish compared to the previous games.
 
According to IGN, Ninja Gaiden 2 is \"easily one of the best action games on Xbox 360\" and \"the depth in combat is as exciting as ever\"[^1^]. The reviewer also noted that \"the new gameplay additions and changes only add to the experience\", such as the ability to dismember enemies and use their limbs as weapons. However, the reviewer also pointed out that \"the game has been focused from its predecessor into a more pure action affair, for better or for worse\", and that \"the formula remains the same -- frustrating camera and all\"[^1^].
 
According to GameSpot, Ninja Gaiden 2 is \"a great game and a maddening one\"[^2^]. The reviewer praised the game for being \"flashier and bloodier\" than the previous games, and for offering \"the best action available on the platform\"[^2^]. The reviewer also appreciated the changes made to the save system and health regeneration, which made the game less tedious. However, the reviewer also complained that \"the camera has taken a turn for the worse\", and that \"the badly implemented camera and other factors can lead to trial-and-error repetition that relies more on dumb luck than on your controller-wielding prowess\"[^2^]. The reviewer also felt that \"it isn't as slickly paced as its precursors\", and that \"it isn't the visual leap forward that Ninja Gaiden was\"[^2^].
